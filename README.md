# AI Agent Workspace

This is the master branch. It contains global documentation and folder structure for all AI agent projects in this repository.

## Structure

- `/frontend` – UI or client-facing components  
- `/backend` – Server-side logic, MCP integrations, or tool APIs  
- Other branches contain active agent implementations

Each folder includes its own `README.md` for context.

## Active Branches

- `agent/llm-sysinst-tools`  
  → Basic AI agent using LLM + System Instruction + ToolCall  
- `agent/mcp-llm-sysinst-tools`  
  → Evolved agent with backend (MCP) integration

Use these branches to view or work on specific agent versions.

## Notes

- Master is for structure and documentation only  
- Follow commit guidelines if defined in `commit-convention.md`  
- Each working agent exists on a versioned branch under `agent/`
